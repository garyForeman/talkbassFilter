This filter can be applied to all pages of the TalkBass classifieds forum.
Its purpose is to filter threads based on price range.
To run the filter, you'll need an add-on for your web browser that can run
user scripts. 
[Here are some suggestions](https://greasyfork.org/help/installing-user-scripts)
. Personally, I use Greasemonkey for the Mozilla Firefox web browser. For easy 
installation, download from
[Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/5340-talkbass-price-filter).
**This script uses cookies. For full functionality, make sure you have enabled

values specified by the user can be saved as he or she navigates through pages 
of listings. After the user enters filter values, cookies may be deleted using 
the "Reset Filter" button generated by the script.

SOFT filter
-----------

The soft filter only removes threads that explicitly lie outside the specified 
price range. The following type of threads will continue to be displayed: 
- Threads without a price listing 
- Threads with a price listing that cannot be converted to a float 
- "For Trade" threads 
- "SOLD," "TRADED," and "No longer available" threads 

HARD filter
-----------

The hard filter only displays threads that explicitly lie inside the specified 
price range. "SOLD," "TRADED," and "No longer available" threads are also 
removed.
