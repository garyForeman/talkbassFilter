This filter can be applied to all pages of the TalkBass classifieds forum.
Its purpose is to filter threads based on price range.
[Find the video demo here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyZE_YJ5kZg&index=1&list=UUM6F76aBajCks2diljMPg0Q).
To run the filter, you'll need an add-on for your web browser that can run
user scripts. 
[Here are some suggestions](https://greasyfork.org/help/installing-user-scripts)
. Personally, I use Greasemonkey for the Mozilla Firefox web browser. For easy 
installation, download from
[Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/5340-talkbass-price-filter).

SOFT filter
-----------

The soft filter only removes threads that explicitly lie outside the specified 
price range. The following type of threads will continue to be displayed: 
- Threads without a price listing 
- Threads with a price listing that cannot be converted to a float 
- "For Trade" threads 
- "SOLD," "TRADED," and "No longer available" threads 

HARD filter
-----------

The hard filter only displays threads that explicitly lie inside the specified 
price range. "SOLD," "TRADED," and "No longer available" threads are also 
removed.
